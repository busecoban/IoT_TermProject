## Project

**Title of the project:** The Smart Door and Window Sensor System

**Course Name:** CSE 328 Internet of Things 

## Project Objective and Scope

 The Smart Door and Window Sensor System aims to enhance security and convenience by providing real-time monitoring of the open/close status of doors and windows in residential or commercial buildings. The project's primary objectives include accurately detecting door/window events, notifying users of any changes in status, enabling remote monitoring and control, and ensuring energy efficiency. The scope encompasses the deployment of sensors and microcontrollers to detect status changes, the development of a user interface for notifications and control, and the integration of power sources for reliable operation.

## Proposed Methodology and Approach

- Accurately and reliably detecting door/window open/close events.
- Providing real-time notifications to users via a user interface.
- Enabling remote monitoring and control of door/window status.
- Integrating power-efficient components for prolonged operation.
